# Research-Driven-Asset-Allocation-Strategy

This repository implements and compares several research-based quantitative asset allocation models inspired by published whitepapers and practitioner research, including work by Kipnis, Keuning and Keller and related momentum-based allocation studies.
The framework reproduces and modularises multiple systematic allocation approaches, including:
Defensive Asset Allocation (DAA)
Vigilant Asset Allocation (VAA)
Hybrid Asset Allocation (HAA)
Generalized Protective Momentum (GPM)
Kipnis' Defensive Asset Allocation (KDAA)

These models are based on publicly available research and practitioner articles, including work associated with quantitative portfolio research communities.

This project demonstrates experience with:
- Financial API integration (yfinance)
- Multi-horizon momentum modelling
- Correlation and covariance analysis
- Portfolio optimisation concepts
- Risk regime detection
- Systematic allocation design
- Modular research architecture
- Quantitative finance implementation
